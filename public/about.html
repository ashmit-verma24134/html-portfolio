<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a curious and dedicated individual who thrives on learning and exploring new challenges. 
  Whether it's diving deep into a subject or mastering a creative skill, I enjoy pushing my limits and growing 
  through each experience. I believe in staying open-minded and value both structure and spontaneity in my personal and academic life.</p>

<p>My interests span across technology, design, and problem-solving. I find joy in turning ideas into tangible outcomes—whether it's building projects, designing visuals, or analyzing how things work. I approach each task with a blend of logic and creativity, often seeking out opportunities where I can apply both. Teamwork, communication, and persistence are qualities I strive to maintain in everything I do.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time in nature, listening to music, and engaging in meaningful conversations. Balance is important to me, and I believe personal growth is just as vital as professional development. I’m always eager to connect with others, learn from different perspectives, and keep evolving both as a person and a learner.</p>
